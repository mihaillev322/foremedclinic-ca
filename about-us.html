<h1>About Civic Pantry Atlas and our sourcing method</h1>
</header>
<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Mission and audience</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Atlas exists to explain food pantry access in the United States using neutral language and verifiable sources. Our mission centers on providing clear, accurate reference information that helps people understand how food pantries operate, what eligibility patterns exist, and how pantry services connect with broader food assistance systems. We believe that access to reliable information supports better outcomes for individuals seeking food assistance and for communities working to address food insecurity.</p>
<p>Our primary audience includes several distinct groups with overlapping information needs. US residents comparing pantry options benefit from understanding terminology, access models, and documentation norms before contacting local resources. Volunteers and staff at food pantries find value in reference material that explains the broader context of their work. Local officials and planners developing food security initiatives use our explanations to inform policy discussions and community assessments.</p>
<p>Journalists and researchers represent another important audience segment. Reporters covering food insecurity need neutral definitions and verified sources for accurate reporting. Researchers studying food assistance systems benefit from clear explanations of terminology and operational patterns. By providing well-sourced reference material, we support more informed public discourse about food pantry access and food assistance policy.</p>
<p>Understanding what Civic Pantry Atlas does not do is equally important. We are not a directory of specific pantry locations with real-time hours and inventory information. We do not provide emergency food dispatch or crisis intervention services. We do not offer legal advice about eligibility for government programs or individual rights. We do not advocate for specific policies or organizations. Our role is explanation and reference, not service delivery or advocacy.</p>
<p>This scope limitation reflects both practical constraints and editorial philosophy. A static reference site cannot maintain accurate real-time information about thousands of pantries with varying schedules and supplies. More fundamentally, we believe that neutral explanation serves readers better than advocacy-oriented content. By maintaining clear boundaries, we preserve the credibility that makes our reference material useful.</p>
</section>
<section id="method" class="content-section">
<h2>Method: how we write and review</h2>
<p>Our editorial approach follows a consistent pattern designed to maximize clarity and verifiability. We begin by defining terms precisely, drawing on authoritative sources and established usage in the food assistance field. Clear definitions prevent misunderstanding and provide readers with vocabulary they can use when communicating with pantries and other organizations.</p>
<p>After establishing definitions, we describe variability. Food pantry policies and practices differ significantly based on location, funding, organizational mission, and available resources. Rather than presenting a single model as standard, we explain the range of approaches that exist and help readers understand what factors drive variation. This approach prepares readers to encounter different practices without confusion or frustration.</p>
<p>Every substantive claim traces back to identifiable sources. We cite federal guidance for program definitions and rules, nonprofit network materials for operational patterns, and research literature for context and trends. When we describe common practices, we indicate the basis for that characterization. This transparency allows readers to verify information independently and explore topics in greater depth.</p>
<blockquote class="principle-quote">
<p>Writing about food assistance requires particular attention to language that respects dignity. We avoid terms that stigmatize people experiencing food insecurity. We describe circumstances and systems rather than characterizing individuals. We recognize that needing food assistance reflects economic and social conditions, not personal failings. This commitment to respectful language shapes every piece of content we produce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a static reference site, maintaining accuracy requires structured review processes. We conduct quarterly reviews of all content sections, checking cited sources for updates, verifying that linked resources remain available, and assessing whether new developments warrant content revisions. Each section displays a date stamp indicating its last review. When we identify errors, we correct them promptly and note significant changes in our update log.</p>
<p>Our change log documents substantive revisions, distinguishing between minor corrections like fixing typos or broken links and significant updates that change the meaning or scope of content. This transparency helps returning readers understand what has changed and allows researchers to track how our content evolves over time. The log is available upon request for those conducting research or verification.</p>

<h2>Source hierarchy (table)</h2>
<p>We prioritize sources based on their authority, scope, and reliability. The following table explains our source hierarchy and how different source types inform our content. This transparency helps readers understand the evidentiary basis for our explanations and evaluate the reliability of specific claims.</p>

<p>Federal guidance from agencies like the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/tefap" rel="noopener">USDA Food and Nutrition Service</a> provides our foundation for program definitions and rules. When explaining TEFAP, SNAP, WIC, or other federal programs, we rely primarily on official program materials. These sources establish baseline terminology that applies nationwide, even as implementation varies by state.</p>
<p>State and local government sources help us explain regional variations. State human services agencies administer federal programs and may add state-specific provisions. Local 211 systems and municipal resources provide information about community-level services. We use these sources to illustrate how national patterns manifest differently across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Major nonprofit networks like <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/" rel="noopener">Feeding America</a> contribute operational knowledge derived from extensive experience serving communities nationwide. Their guidance documents, research reports, and public communications inform our explanations of how pantries typically operate, what challenges they face, and how practices are evolving.</p>
<p>Academic and research sources provide context that helps readers understand food pantry access within broader social and economic patterns. University-based food policy centers, peer-reviewed studies of food assistance programs, and systematic evaluations of interventions all contribute to our understanding. We use these sources for background and trend analysis rather than operational guidance.</p>
<p>Reputable journalism serves as a supplementary source, particularly for recent developments and investigative findings. We prioritize outlets with transparent editorial standards and fact-checking processes. Journalistic sources help us identify emerging issues and provide accessible explanations that complement more technical materials.</p>

<p>We review all correction reports and respond to substantive issues. When we confirm an error, we correct it promptly and update the relevant section's review date. Significant corrections are noted in our change log. When we determine that reported content is accurate, we may still clarify language if the report indicates potential for reader confusion.</p>
<p>Our accessibility commitment shapes how we present information. We use plain language that avoids unnecessary jargon and explains technical terms when they must be used. Tables include captions and proper header markup for screen reader compatibility. Interactive elements like accordions use semantic HTML that works with keyboard navigation and assistive technologies. We test our content with accessibility tools and welcome reports of accessibility barriers.</p>
